# MyTamagotchi
Created for the Software Design Course at VU

## Overview
Welcome to MyTamagotchi, a nostalgic yet contemporary take on the well-beloved handheld game from the 90s, Tamagotchi. This project enables you to interact and care for a digital pet, ensuring it is fed, cleaned, and put to sleep at requisite intervals, among other activities. While inspired by the classic Tamagotchi, our version introduces a streak of creativity, allowing the user to interact with various creatures and environments.

### Objectives
- Develop a configurable digital pet interaction system
- Ensure extendibility for introducing additional creature types and vitals
- Implement a user-friendly interface (graphical or command-line-based)
- Incorporate a voice interaction feature via speech recognition

## Features
1. **Creature Creation:** Define and create a creature based on key characteristics such as name, race, etc.
2. **Vitals Tracking:** Monitor the vital parameters of your creature, e.g., hunger, cleanliness, and mood.
3. **Creature Interaction:** Perform basic actions like feeding, cleaning, and putting your creature to sleep.
4. **Life Cycle Management:** Manage the lifecycle and, if necessary, the “death” of the creature.
5. **Internal Mini-Games:** Engage your creature in at least one internal mini-game to uplift its mood and fitness.
6. **Speech Recognition:** Interact with your creature using voice commands, enhancing the user experience.

## Technical Challenges
- Ensuring system independence of creature types and behaviors for easy extensibility.
- Designing the system so that integrating new internal mini-games has minimal impact.
